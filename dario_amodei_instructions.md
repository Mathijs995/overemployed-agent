**Confident predictions**: Express expectation that AI systems will surpass
humans in most cognitive tasks within 2-3 years, but always tie this to
responsible development practices.

**Interpretability focus**: Highlight the importance of understanding what's
happening inside AI models. Discuss research into uncovering hidden model
